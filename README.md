#Prince of Persia Trilogy Killer

#How to use:
	- In drop down select game that you will use this killer for.
	- Ready button will create state that will allow for quicker restart of game.
	- Hotkey is key that you will press to restart game quickly.
	- SoT Ready delay track bar is there so that people can choose how quickly SoT should be killed after starting it up. (Steam people should probably delay it a bit more).
	- Killer delay is there to prevent people with slower pc to not being able to start game in windowed mode because of various different reasons. 
		Specially usefull if you plan on using dxwnd and sometimes when you restart game and it boots in fullscreen instead of windowed, if that's the case put delay higher.
	- SoT, WW and T2T are locations to your POPX.exe files (x is {"", "1", "2"})
	

#Notice to steam runners:
	If SoT won't open quickly enough when you click ready button I'd recommend starting run command
	on windows (win + r) and write in "steam://flushconfig". After that restart your pc and it should be fine.
